		<h1>Gretchen's Biography</h1>
		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<p>
		Hi! My name is Gretchen Harken and I am a Junior at Syracuse University who is dual majoring in Television, Radio, Film at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and Information Management & Technology at the iSchool with a concentration in Web Design and Management. I am driven by a curiosity about technology and its impact on the media industry. Currently, I am the Head of Content Creation at the student-run late-night comedy show, Live from Studio B (LFSB). In addition to this position, I am concurrently training to fill the role of Executive Producer for the show in the Fall of 2022. I have extensive knowledge of Google, Adobe, and Microsoft Suites, in addition to a solid understanding of both Windows and Mac operating systems.

		Outside of school, I participate in intramural soccer and am a member of the Syracuse Club Ski Team. My idea of relaxing is getting to spend time with those closest to me, and I especially enjoy hanging out with those who work alongside me at LFSB (never a dull moment with a group of comedy writers). My favorite movies of all time are:
		<ul>
			<li>Whiplash</li>
			<li>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</li>
			<li>School of Rock</li>
			<li>The Shawshank Redemption</li>
		</ul>
		I am currently on a spider solitaire kick and have been playing the daily puzzle for a year now (also I have been kicking Wordle in the <strong>butt</strong> the past week).

		One of my professors this semester challenged her class with choosing 5 words/traits that best describe each person. I really liked the exercise so here are the five words I choose that I believe best describe who I am as a person: Intellectual, Silly, Curious, Caring, and Disciplined.
