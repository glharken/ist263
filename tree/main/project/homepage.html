            LFSB was created in the spring of 2017 by Syracuse alumni, Josh Feinblatt and Lizzie Michael. It is loosely modeled off the style of the famous NBC show, Saturday Night Live. Although the show began with a mere twenty person staff, it has grown tremendously over the past five years and is now run by nearly 100 Syracuse students!

            Our show offers a variety of content ranging from monologue jokes, interviews, pre-taped segments, and more recently, comedic music videos!
