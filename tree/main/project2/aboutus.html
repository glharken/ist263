                    Live from Studio B as a freshman writer and this show got me into comedy and led to me meeting so 
                    many wonderful, talented people and I learned so many writing and production skills that led me to becoming the current Executive Producer! Not only did this show introduce me to sketch comedy and television experience, but I had the opportunity to learn how to perform stand-up comedy and improv!”
